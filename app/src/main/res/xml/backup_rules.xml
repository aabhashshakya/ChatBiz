<!--
<exclude> - Specifies a file or folder to exclude during backup.
Here are some files that are typically excluded from backup:
-> Files that have device specific identifiers, either issued by a server or generated on the device.
For example, Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) needs to generate a registration token every time a user installs your app on a new
device. If the old registration token is restored, the app may behave unexpectedly.
-> Account credentials or other sensitive information. Consider asking the user to reauthenticate the first time they launch a
restored app rather than allowing for storage of such information in the backup.
-> Files related to app debugging.
-> Large files that cause the app to exceed the 25MB backup quota.
